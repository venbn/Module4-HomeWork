I use Jupyter notebook to write the Python code and all my code is built on a Mac PC. 
To built the environment to execute this code, you will need to have python3 and pip3 installed already.

## Dependencies

Apart from python3 and pip3, you will need to have jupyter, anaconda and matplotlib installed at the operating system level.
All the dependent librariries required to successfully use pandas and numpy modules must be installed as well as the code is heavily dependent on pandas, numpy and matplotlib modules.

## Pre-requisites

Ensure all the below csv files are existing on the OS from where you are executing the code. You will need to run "Jupyter notebook" from the same directory where all the files exist. Below is the list of files which need to exist for the successful execution of the code.

whales_analysis.csv
sp500_history.csv
algo_returns.csv
goog.csv
twtr.csv
nyse.csv
whales_analysis.ipnyb
